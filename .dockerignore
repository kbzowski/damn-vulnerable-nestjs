# VULNERABILITY: Weak .dockerignore that doesn't exclude sensitive files
# This file intentionally allows sensitive files to be copied to Docker image

# Commented out exclusions (VULNERABILITIES):
# .env
# .env.local
# .env.production
# .env.staging
# *.log
# logs/
# secrets/
# private_keys/
# certificates/
# backups/

# Only excluding minimal development files
node_modules/.cache
coverage/
.nyc_output
.coverage

# VULNERABILITY: Not excluding important files:
# - .env files with secrets
# - Log files with sensitive data  
# - Private keys and certificates
# - Database files
# - Backup files
# - Configuration with secrets
# - SSH keys
# - API key files

# What SHOULD be excluded but isn't:
# .env*
# *.log
# logs/
# *.key
# *.pem
# *.p12
# *.jks
# secrets/
# private/
# config/
# backups/
# *.db

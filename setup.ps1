.SYNOPSIS
Vulnerable NestJS Shop - Setup Script (PowerShell Edition)
This script sets up an intentionally vulnerable application for ethical security education.

.DESCRIPTION
This is a translation of a Bash setup script for Windows using PowerShell.
It checks prerequisites (Node.js, npm), installs dependencies, sets up the database,
and creates test files for vulnerability practice.

.NOTES
WARNING: This application contains intentional security vulnerabilities!
DO NOT use in production or deploy to public environments!
For educational purposes only!
